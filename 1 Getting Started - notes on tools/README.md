# GETTING YOUR DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT AND HARDWARE SET UP FOR THIS PROJECT

This folder is where we can put how to info on getting tools installed or how to use them.

If you are starting fresh or new to all thise stuff I suggest the following:

## Project Development Environment 
**(I use a windows laptop, others prefer macs, some use linux, the following works on all these):**
1. *Install VSCODE* - this makes developing everything easier from firmware coding to AI experimenting (with native support for running tensorflow files in a virtual environment).
2. *Install the PlatformIO extension* on VSCODE.  This will help manage all the microcontroller board configurations and load libraries you need automatically.  Works great. 
Here us a dated but decent [tutorial](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/vs-code-platformio-ide-esp32-esp8266-arduino/) that can walk you through all the VSCODE setup from scratch on all the different operating systems (https://randomnerdtutorials.com/vs-code-platformio-ide-esp32-esp8266-arduino/).

## Home Automation:
1. *Buy a Pi*: I recommend getting a new Raspberry Pi with a power supply and a micro SD card.  You can using it as a dedicated HomeAssistant server that can receive streaming audio from the ESP32 devices and take actions. That will give you a linux system to work with on your network if you didn't have one already.
2. *Install HomeAssistant IO on the Pi*.  Here's a [tutorial](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi/). (https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi/)
