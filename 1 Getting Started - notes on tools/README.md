**GETTING YOUR DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS SET UP**

This folder is where we can put how to info on getting tools installed or how to use them.

If you are starting fresh or new to all thise stuff I suggest the following:

**Project Development Environment (I use a windows laptop, others prefer macs, some use linux, the following works on all these):**
1.Install VSCODE - this makes developing everything easier from firmware coding to AI experimenting (with native support for running tensorflow files in a virtual environment).
2.Install the PlatformIO extension on VSCODE

**Home Automation:**
1.Buy a Pi: I recommend getting a new Raspberry Pi with a power supply and a micro SD card.  You can using it as a dedicated HomeAssistant server that can receive streaming audio from the ESP32 devices and take actions. That will give you a linux system to work with on your network if you didn't have one already.
2.Install HomeAssistant IO on the Pi.  (https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi/)
