**Circuit Board design using ESP-32 WROOM with MEMS microphone**

The circuit board was designed using KiCAD and the parts were selected from what was available at JLCPCB.  The intent is that all of the parts will be surface mount except for the headers which will be through hole and optional.  JLCPCB will do single sided SMT assembly and only charge for the price of the components.
